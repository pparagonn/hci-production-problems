    <h2>Reasoning behind typeface selection:</h2>
    <p>Playfair Display has a transitional design from when broad nib quills were replaced by
    pointed steel pens. Since Playfair Display has print letterforms of high contrast and delicate
    hairlines, it pairs well with the more simplistic Source Sans Pro. In regard to strategies, this
    would fall under "Embrace the Other" because of their duplexity in differences.</p>
