## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:
https://paletton.com/#uid=10I0u0kvsq2lAwGrCuQ-rliI2g4
Your Rationale:
I chose an the monochromatic color of orange (45 degree hue) because of the meaning of the color orange and because of the current gaming console market. Xbox uses green, PS5 uses blue, and Switch (Nintendo) uses red. Therefore, selecting a different color that signifies Energy and Happiness will envoke a feeling of excitement of video games to entice the target audience of this website to read through the website... and hopefully purchase the console.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:
https://paletton.com/#uid=51o0u0kmQJWceUvi4PbryEu-fvU
Your Rationale:
I chose this adjacent color palette because of the difference in between the orangeness throughout the colors. Since it is a springtime tour it invites the audience to feel a sense of Happiness and hope alongside happiness and vitality.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:
https://paletton.com/#uid=33w0P0kxp++kc+mqh+WUB+VZECq
Your Rationale:
I choose this triadic color palette because it resembles very foundational colors. It provides that easy identification and bright feeling especially for kids who use colors to associate knowledge and thus can feel a more comfortable soft feeling.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:
https://paletton.com/#uid=13X0u0kurdUa1C0m2jIFoacWg36
Your Rationale:
I've chosen to use a combination that utilizes dark blue, black and purple to stimulate the idea of anonymity and evil. However, it is not primarily black as well for that reason. The bigger colors will be blue and purple to still have a brighter effect to showcase the positive side of a cybersecurity course which is to do good and not bad in the realm of cybersecurity.
