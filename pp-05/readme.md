## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results).

From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your
teams’s interface from Project Two**.

Finally, I highly encourage you to work on this Production Problem with your team for Project
Two/Three to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist, and smooth the way forward
for your first (and second) round of usability testing.

## Deliverables

* Your team’s condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. Orientation: Users clearly know the name of the organization store at all times. Users know what is offered by the succulent shop throughout their entire time on the website.
2. Labels: Label for items and for content sections are clear, written with common terms for users, and are directly related to the content following. Class and id are also named the same way. Page titles are also held to this standard
3. Links: Links names are accurate to the content that users reach when they are clicked and are visually distinct from non-hyperlink text.
4. Navigation: Navigation process is clear and identifiable. There is a clear way to move throughout the checkout process and get to different pages. Users can return to the home page at any time. Users can get back to the top of the page quickly (when necessary).
5. Visual Design: Content is clear and aesthetically pleasing. Colors are consistent with the color scheme. Layout is clean, legible, and readable.
6. Readability: Font and text is clear and consistent on all pages. Bold, upper-caps, and italics are used sparingly and only to highlight things only when needed.
7. Information: Users are able to quickly scan through pages to find the information they need. Text is also short and scannable.
8. Errors: There are no spelling errors on the website. Error messages are provided to the user when needed and give suggestions.
9. Functionality: The website should be usable across various browsers. Even if certain elements are unable to display (i.e., images), the website can still function properly and attribtues are set in place (i.e., alt) to describe the information.
10. Screen Size: he website prioritizes designing for mobile/smaller screen sizes. As the size screen increases, grids are used to help adjust the layout of the website.
